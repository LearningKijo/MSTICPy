# msticpy - Getting Started
First of all, I am going to cover leveraging msticpy in **"Local Machine"** environment, NOT in Notebooks, Microsoft Sentinel.

0. Create API app in Azure AD
1. install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
2. install [msticpy](https://github.com/microsoft/msticpy)
3. Configure [msticpyconfig.yaml](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/notebooks-msticpy-advanced?tabs=windows#set-an-environment-variable-for-your-msticpyconfigyaml-file)

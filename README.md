# MSTICPy
MSTICPy is an open-source Python package developed by Microsoft that provides a suite of tools for security professionals to perform threat hunting, data analysis, and visualization tasks.

> msticpy is a set of Python tools intended to be used for security investigations and hunting. Many of the tools originated as code Jupyter notebooks written to solve a problem as part of a security investigation. Some of tools them are only useful in notebooks (e.g. the widgets and visualizations) but many others can be used from the Python commandline or imported into your code. <br>
